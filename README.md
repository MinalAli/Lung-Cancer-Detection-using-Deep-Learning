# Lung-Cancer-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
This project uses deep learning techniques to develop a model for lung cancer detection. The model leverages advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, particularly the Xception model, to classify medical images (e.g., CT scans, X-rays).The goal is to improve early detection of lung cancer.
